Our platform is self-service, meaning that you can update your listing yourself! To update your listing:

1. Go to https://admin.thegreenwebfoundation.org/provider-portal/ and login.
2. You will be shown your verified providers. Find the one you want to change, and click the “Edit” link.

5. Any changes made will need to be manually verified.

Yearly reverification
In order to remain as an active verified green host in our dataset, you will need to update/reconfirm your evidence on a yearly basis. By doing this, you demonstrate to us that you still meet the criteria for being a verified hosting provider.
