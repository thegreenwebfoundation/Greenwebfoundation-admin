Dear hoster,

{% if user.date_joined %}On {{ user.date_joined }}{% else %}Some time in the past{% endif %} you registered {{ host.name }} at the Green Web Directory [1]. Since it is not directly clear to us why and how you are green hosted, we kindly ask you to provide us with the following additional information:

Could you refer us to your corporate social responsibility page, or a comparable page where you explain how you have approached to become a green hoster or website?

Is it possible to refer us to a valid certificate awarded to yourself or the company that provides your digital infrastructure to you?

Thanks for your help in keeping the Green Web Directory up-to-date! Weâ€™re experiencing significant growth in the number of checks against the database, currently over 7 million per day and counting, so it does make sense!

With best regards,
The Green Web Foundation Support Team
