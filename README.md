# Green Web Foundation Admin Portal

Welcome to the administration system for the Green Web Foundation.

This is the system visible at https://admin.thegreenwebfoundation.org.

It lets staff working for hosting companies update information about how they power their infrastructure and generates the open datasets we publish each month.

Just here for the datasets? See the [datasets](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/greenwebfoundation-admin/blob/master/docs/working-with-greenweb-datasets.md)
