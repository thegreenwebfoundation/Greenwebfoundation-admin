		<p>Completing the form will take you between <span class="font-bold">5 and 10 minutes</span> of time.</p>

		<p>Regretfully, you are not able to save a partially completed form and come back it later - yet!</p>
		
		<p>Therefore, we recommend you gather the information required before beginning to fill in the form, 
			and enter it in one uninterrupted session.</p>

		<h3 class="font-bold text-xl uppercase">What information you need</h3>
		<p class="mt-6">Here's a summary of the key data we ask you to supply via the form.<p>
      	
		<ul>
			<li><span class="font-bold">Basic data</span> about your organisation such as name, main website URL and a paragraph description of what you do.
			<li><span class="font-bold">Locations</span> for your office headquarters and if applicable the datacenters you own. For each we ask for the country and nearest city. We offer a .csv bulk import option<span class="font-bold">*</span> if you have several to add.</li>
			<li>The <span class="font-bold">IP or ASN ranges</span> your organisation is responsible for. We offer a few options to automate this for large numbers or evolving records such as one-off .csv bulk import<span class="font-bold">*</span> or automated updating via api.</li>
			<li><span class="font-bold">Evidence</span>, so we can verify your claims that your services run on green energy or your upstream supplier does. You can provide URLs or upload documents.</li> 
		</ul>

            <p class="text-neutral-600">If you want to use the bulk import option for your locations or IP/ASN ranges, then you do not supply the .csv file as part of this verification form. We will arrange this with you after your verification form is submitted.</p>
