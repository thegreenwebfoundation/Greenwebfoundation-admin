            <p>Green Web Foundation is on a mission to make the internet fossil-free by 2030. We maintain the world's largest open dataset on websites running on green energy, the <i>Green Domains Dataset</i>.</p>
			<p>Every day, across the globe, more than seven million checks against this dataset are made.</p>
			<p>If you are a hosting provider getting verified with us allow you to show as green, and therefore become visible as a findable and trusted source.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl border-b-2">How can I get verified? </h3>
            <p>To become verified, you need to submit a verification request that provides proof that you use green energy for your services. You can prove this if you are avoiding, reducing, or offsetting emissions.</p>
			<p>Submitting the request will approximately take you 15 minutes and is free of charge.</p>
			<p>Once submitted, we will review your request and get in touch if further evidence is needed. We are a non-profit organisation, so the verification process is independent.</p>
